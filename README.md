# RAG-Collection
This repository contains an implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach that enhances large language models by connecting them to external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on parametric knowledge, RAG systems retrieve relevant information before generating responses, leading to more accurate, up-to-date.
